How It Works
---------------------------
- You choose a password length between 6–30
- You choose which character types to include
- The program builds a character pool based on your choices
- One mandatory character from each selected type is added
- The remaining characters are randomly selected from the pool
- All characters are shuffled to maximize randomness
- Multiple passwords can be generated at once
- You can generate new passwords as many times as you like
